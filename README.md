# PictureRealignExercise
I was tasked with realigning mixed up images on a webpage!

This project displays a collection of classical images in a 3D cube layout on a webpage. The images are positioned to create the illusion of a rotating cube using CSS 3D transformations. The page also includes a styled header and some custom styling for the text.

Features
3D Cube Layout: Five images are arranged to form a cube, each image is positioned on one of the cube's faces.
CSS Styling: The images have sepia filters and shadows applied to create a classic look.
Interactive Alert: When the page is loaded, a JavaScript alert appears with the message "My Classical Images."
Text Styling: The page contains a title with a text-shadow and custom styling for the first letter and first line of a paragraph.

How It Works
HTML Structure: The images are placed inside a <*div*> with an id of a cube. Each image is given a specific id and styled with CSS.
CSS 3D Transformations: The transform property is used to position each image on the cube's faces, with various rotations and translations applied.
JavaScript: When the page is loaded, an alert box is shown with a message.
